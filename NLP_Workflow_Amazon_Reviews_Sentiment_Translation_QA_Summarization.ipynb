Lo he leído de portada a cubierta 3 o 4 veces y he probado casi todas las recetas que sugiere. Son simplemente fantásticos. He observado mi peso y ejercitado regularmente la mayor parte de mi vida.... ahora siento que, con su ayuda, estoy en el camino correcto con la nutrición, también. Si sólo todos seguiríamos su consejo, tal vez habría menos personas teniendo que lidiar con el cáncer de mama. Recomiendo encarecidamente leer este libro.\n",
